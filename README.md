42 is a tuition-free and open 24/7 computer programming school based on peer-to-peer learning, without teachers ,lectures and schedules, entirely *up-to-you* and project-based.

The access method is known as the *Piscine*, in where candidates start writing their first lines of code in order to learn the basics of both Shell, C and logic programming..

This repository contains my solutions to the problems found throughout the *Piscine* taken from 1st to 26th of July in Madrid ([learn more here](https://www.42madrid.com/)).
